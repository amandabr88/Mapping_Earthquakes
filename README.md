# Mapping_Earthquakes

## Overview

The purpose of this project is to create an earthquake map with two different maps and the earthquake overlay. The final goal of this project is to delivery a map with the earthquake data in relation to the tectonic platesâ€™ location on the earth. Also, all the earthquakes with a magnitude greater than 4.5 should be on the map.

## Deliverables

Deliverable 1: Add Tectonic Plate Data
Deliverable 2: Add Major Earthquake Data
Deliverable 3: Add an Additional Map
